Chiron Sung HK: a typeface for Traditional Chinese users
=======================

Chiron Sung HK (昭源宋體) is a Traditional Chinese serif typeface based on [Adobe](https://adobe.com/)’s [Source Han Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif) (a.k.a. [Google](https://www.google.com)’s [Noto Sans CJK](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-cjk/)). The font aims at providing a modern, region-agnostic glyph set adopting the “modern” glyph style that is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial, typefaces in the Traditional Chinese regions.
